DFA Complement Exercise
=======================

DFA Complement Exercise
-----------------------

HINT: If DFA :math:`M` accepts language :math:`L`, the we can create a
machine to accept the complement of :math:`L` by reversing the final
and non-final states of :math:`M`.
However, that only works on a complete DFA, meaning that we have to
take into account the trap state.
