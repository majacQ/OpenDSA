Understanding this Course
=========================


Who Is This Class For?
----------------------

This course teaches introductory programming in Java, with a significant
emphasis on object-oriented software design and on software testing.
It is taken by students majoring in Computer Science, minoring
in Computer Science, and also by students in other majors thinking about
studying Computer Science.

It can be very helpful if you have already had some exposure to programming.
Basic familiarity with variables and sequential logic will give you a leg up.
However, the course is designed to be approachable by beginners who do not
have any significant programming background. Indeed, it has developed to help
people who are interested in starting on a path towards a programming career
who are coming from other, not-computing disciplines.


Students of Many Experience Levels
----------------------------------


While this course is designed and intended for beginners, please be aware
that students from a very wide range of backgrounds take this course, including
some students who may have significant amounts of prior programming
experience. Just remember that while there are many reasons why students who
already know how to program might take this course, the course isn't intended
for that audience. You may see such students in the course discussions, asking
and answering questions that appear to
require significantly more programming knowledge. The course staff are happy
to answer such questions, but please remember that we do not expect students
in this course to possess that level of knowledge or to perform as if they
have already learned how to program prior to taking this course.


Online, Asynchronous, Self-paced
--------------------------------

This course is designed to be taken in an asynchronous, self-paced fashion.
All students share the same syllabus, course content, and assignments.
However, be aware that the course website on Canvas and the course
discussion areas involve students who are at different places in the course,
and progressing at different speeds, so you will likely to
see questions or information that span the course.

While the course is self-paced, we strongly encourage students to complete the
course in 12 weeks. We do this for two reasons. First, the course is designed
around 12, one-week units which will allow students to complete the course in
a sufficiently long time to grasp the material, but not so long that they don't
complete it in time to enroll in classes during the fall semester. Secondly,
research has show that students in a self-paced course are more likely not to
complete the course if there is an open-ended deadline. We want you to complete
the course successfully, and have a time window for completion will help you to
achieve this success.


Course Support
---------------


Weekly Schedule
---------------

This course is designed around weekly units. This allows you to plan how far
you need to get week-to-week to stay on track. Also, the course is designed
so that the material you learn in one week is the background you need for the
material covered in the following week. Make sure to do the work in order,
to stay on track, and so you are adequately prepared for each new topic
covered in the course.


Reading Activities
------------------

Each unit begins with a Reading Activity that includes embedded exercises
to check your understanding and to allow you to practice what you are learning.
These exercises are important to make sure you understand the material, so
don't skip them. They will prepare you for the lab and project exercises.

Labs
----

Each unit also includes a lab assignment. These labs give you hands-on
experience with more structure than a typical programming assignment.
You can submit your lab as many times a you want, and make corrections based on the
feedback you receive. Labs are intended as practice activities to reinforce the concepts
you are learning, and it is natural and expected that you may regularly run into situations
where you wish to ask TAs for clarification or assistance on something you have not seen
before. This is what the course discussion boards are for.


Programming Assignments <<TODO: REVISIT>>
-----------------------------------------

Programming assignments will be part of each unit. Programming assignments typically come
in pairs: in one, your programming assignment will be to work on a brand new problem
setting up your solution and making sure you have a solid starting point. The next, your
programming assignment will be to fill in the remainder of that starting point to flesh
it out into a full solution.


In this course, we will cover a total of <<TODO: INSERT FINAL NUMBER HERE>> programming
assignments, arranged in <<TODO: INSERT FINAL NUMBER HERE>> pairs. Each odd-numbered
assignment will start a completely new problem
with setting up your solution, and each even-numbered assignment will involve
building the corresponding solution to a working final product.
This means that the work necessary for the first assignment in each
pair is an integral element of your solution for the second assignment of the
pair the following week. So even if you fail to turn in the first part, you
will still need to make up the work in order to successfully complete the
second half. Please keep this in mind when planning how to approach the
programs.

Programming Language and Environment  <<TODO: REVISIT>>
-------------------------------------------------------

This course teaches programming using Java. We will use the Eclipse IDE
for code development in class, including all examples shown in lecture.
See the "Install Eclipse" link on the course home page for installation
instructions. The version on Canvas includes
the necessary user libraries necessary for assignments in this course,
and lab or programming assignments will not compile without these.
